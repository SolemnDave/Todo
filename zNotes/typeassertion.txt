Type assertion in TypeScript is a way to tell the compiler about the type of a variable, allowing you to work with the variable under a certain type assumption. 
It's like type casting in other languages but without performing any special checks or restructuring of data. It does not change the type of the variable outside 
of TypeScript's type checking system. Instead, it is purely used by the compiler for type checking and has no impact at runtime.
