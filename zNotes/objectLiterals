Object Literals in JavaScript/TypeScript
Object Literals: 
In JavaScript and TypeScript, an object literal is a way to create an object. It's a list of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces {}. 
Each key-value pair is a property of the object, where the key is the property name (usually a string), and the value can be anything: a number, a string, a boolean, another object, a function, etc.

For example:

javascript
Copy code
let person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  isStudent: false
};

Here, person is an object with three properties: name, age, and isStudent.
